##Introduction (Problem formulation)
* A real-world infererence task/problem
* The key modeling/methodological/challege, clearly associating with the project theme we chose

##Background 
* sufficient context needed to understand the problem
* Relevant literature is cited and summarized

##Methods 
* Bayesian model is precisely described(using ~ notation)
* Prior choice is motivated. If appropriate, several choices are compared or sensitivity analysis is performed. 
* Critical evaluation of the posterior approximation. An appropriate combination of diagnostics, synthetic datasets and other validation strategies.

##Results 

##Discussion 
- Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) may come into play when grouping data

##Conclusion
* key limitations

## Appendix A
* implementation code in the appendix (using Stan)
